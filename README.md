## 🚨 What is CivicFix AI?

**CivicFix AI** is a production-style smart civic issue reporting and resolution platform built for real Sri Lankan public infrastructure problems.

Citizens can report issues such as damaged roads, broken street lights, garbage collection problems, drainage blocks, flood risks, water leaks and unsafe public areas. The system uses AI-style classification, priority scoring, duplicate detection, map-based reporting, role-based dashboards and authority workflow tracking.

> **Tagline:** `Report Problems. Track Progress. Build Better Cities.`

## 🏆 Interview Explanation

> I built CivicFix AI as a smart city civic issue reporting platform for real Sri Lankan public infrastructure problems. Citizens can report issues with location and images, while the system uses AI-style classification to detect the issue type, calculate priority score, suggest the correct department, detect duplicates and manage the full resolution workflow. Admins and department officers get role-based dashboards with maps, analytics, SLA timers and report timelines. This project demonstrates React, backend API design, MongoDB modeling, authentication, role-based access control, maps, analytics, validations and real-world problem solving.

- 🛰️ Add geospatial heatmap clustering
- 📱 Build mobile app version with React Native
- 📩 SMS notifications for citizens
- 🧾 PDF report export
- 🏛️ Real municipal council integration
- 📷 Computer vision for issue severity detection
